- I learned how to fork a repository to experiment changes without affecting the original.
- I learned how to use a pull request to let others know of changes for feedback.
- I learned how to use markdown for fun styling.
- I learned about issues and their benefit for tracking tasks.
- I learned about branches.

## What I am still confused about:
**I think I have a good understanding about all the features on Github.  There are only a couple things I am confused about
but they also may seem more like concerns.  In the future when working with others I have some worries about keeping
track of eachothers work and changes.  Submitting assignments and making sure you can see them is another concern I have
as I am still getting familiar with github.  Hopefully this lab will be confirmation that I know how to do this correctly.
I'll be sure to learn and experiment whenever I can.**
